      <h4>My Favourite 'Past-time':</h4>
      <span className="quote">
        History doesn't repeat itself, but it does often rhymes
      </span>
      <span className="author">(Mark Twain)</span>
      &nbsp; rings true to me, the almost eerie relatability of our ancestors-
      despite all the progress dividing us- fascinates me!
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Previously:</h4>
      I have explored Antiquity, The Islamic Golden Age, Medieval Eurasia, The
      Age Of Discovery, The Gunpowder Empires, The Age of Imperialism, and
      Decolonization.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Current Fascination:</h4>
      These days I'm preoccupied with the early modern period, in which the
      beginnings of true globalization, the fundamental foundation of the modern
      world (particularly regarding World-Systems Theory), and the infancy of
      current political paradigms began.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Next In Line:</h4>
      In the next few years, I hope to tackle the Victorian age, a much more
      recognizable world, which's consequences are much more easily translatable
      to current events.
