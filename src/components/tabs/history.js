      I love all things History! from the start of human civilization to
      contemporary geopolitics, History's intersection with creativity and

      Mark Twain's observation
      <span>"History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes"</span> rings
      true to me, the almost eerie relatability of our ancestors- despite all
      the "progress" dividing us- is quite astonishing.

      Periods I have explored in the past include Antiquity, The Islamic Golden
      Age, Medieval Eurasia, The Age Of Discovery, The Gunpowder Empires, The
      Age of Imperialism, and Decolonization.

      Currently, I'm preoccupied with the early modern period, the beginnings of
      true globalization in this period, the fundamental foundations of the
      modern world laid out (particularly regarding World-systems theory), and
      the infancy of current archetypes.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the next few years, I hope to tackle the Victorian age, a much more
      recognizable world, which's consequences are much more easily translatable
      to current events.
