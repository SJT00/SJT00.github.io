      Here's my opinion on the last book I finished: <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Dreams from My Father</h4>
      An autobiography by Obama (before he even became a state senator), this is
      really a generational chronicle, narrating his upbringing, and perspective
      with that of his fathers, and even grandfather.
      <br />
      <br />

      . Due to not quite being in the public eye at this point, Obama's words
      are quite raw and honest, detailing everything from resentment, anger, and
      nihilism to drug use and trauma.

      <h5>Overall</h5>
      A great read, although a little boring during his community organizational
      work. Still his reflections on being an outsider in two-hybrid cultures,
      his resentment towards his nation, his maternal family, the establishment
      they represent, and his genuine search for some sense of heritage, are all
      universal themes that unfortunately remain timeless.

      <h5>My Favourite Part</h5>
      During his trip to Kenya, his meeting with his paternal family, and their
      narration of his grandfather's and his own father's lives. The contrast
      between the two, their differing views on the realities of a colonized and
      globalized world, are a great illustration of two generations' varying
      approaches and opportunities in a new time.
